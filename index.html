    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>After Finishing School major in Interior Design, I relocated to Asia to persuit a carrer in architecture, and hopitality.  I worked on signature designs of a Beach Resort in my home town of Mui ne, Vietnam.  After running and maintaning the business for several years, I decided to move back to America.</p>

    <p>I went back to school, and graduated with a BS Degree in Computer Science. From then on, I went on as a student of Thinkful to concentrate on Web Development.  I choose Thinkful among many strong schools, and I'm happy with my decision </p>

    <p>If you are looking for a Front End Web Developer, who is a great team player, I am your man.  I'm excited to join your team and build great websites.</p>
